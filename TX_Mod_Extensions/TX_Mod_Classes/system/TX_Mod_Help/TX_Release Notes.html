<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Release 088 (December 2018)</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This release includes various new modules, bug fixes and other changes:. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b><i>New modules:</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>CompanderMB & CompanderMB St</b> <br>
[Insert Modules category: Audio: Dynamics]</span><br>
- Multiband compander - splits the input signal into 4 frequency bands with a compander on each band which can function as a compressor or expander/ gate.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>DistortionMB & DistortionMB St</b> <br>
[Insert Modules category: Audio: Distortion]</span><br>
- Multiband distortion - splits the input signal into 4 frequency bands and adds distortion, giving a roughness and/or warmth to the signal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>FM Filter & FM Filter St</b> <br>
[Insert Modules category: Audio: EQ & Filter]</span><br>
- Filters audio signals using a resonant filter. Frequency modulation (internal or external) can be used to add complexity to the sound.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Freq Shift & Freq Shift St</b> <br>
[Insert Modules category: Audio: Pitch & Freq Shift]</span><br>
'Freq Shift implements single sideband amplitude modulation, also known as frequency shifting, but not to be confused with pitch shifting.'<br>
'Frequency shifting moves all the components of a signal by a fixed amount but does not preserve the original harmonic relationships.'<br>
Frequency modulation (internal or external) is optional</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>LFO Pulse</b> <br>
[Source Modules category: Control: Modulation]</span><br>
- Low Frequency Oscillator that outputs a 'pulse' waveform, where a proportion of the signal will have a value of 1 and the rest a value 0. The proportion depends on the pulse width.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>PolyNote Trigger</b> <br>
[Source Modules category: Control: Note Tools]</span><br>
- PolyNote Trigger can be used to trigger notes in up to 6 polyphonic modules using a control signal from another module, such as Clock Pulse, LFO or Step Sequencer, or using an Action Button on an Interface Screen.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Rotate St</b> <br>
[Insert Modules category: Audio: Channel Tools]</span><br>
- Rotates a stereo input signal in the stereo field, with both manual and automatic rotation available; can be used to add movement to a stereo signal, creating amplitude modulation effects at higher rotation frequencies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>SoftKnee CompMB & SoftKnee CompMB St</b> <br>
[Insert Modules category: Audio: Dynamics]</span><br>
- Multiband compressor - splits the input signal into 4 frequency bands with a compressor on each band which reduces the level of the louder parts of signal. It has the effect of evening out the volume. The type of compression can be changed from Peak Compression to RMS Compression, which responds to a signal over a settable averaging time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Split 2-Band, Split 2-Band St,  <br>Split 4-Band, Split 4-Band St,  <br>Split 8-Band, Split 8-Band St</b><br>
[Source Modules category: Audio: Split]</span><br>
- Split an audio signal into 2/4/8 frequency bands.<br>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Strum</b> <br>
[Source Modules category: Control: Note Tools]</span><br>
- Strum can output trigger pulses and trigger notes in up to 6 polyphonic modules. Whenever, the strum position is moved or modulated, it triggers notes in the current scale - either a preset scale, such as 'Major' or 'Minor', or a Custom Scale which is editable.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Trig to Gate</b> <br>
[Insert Modules category: Control: Modify]</span>.<br>
- Trig to Gate converts a 'trigger' into a 'gate’. When a trigger is received (when a control signal changes from zero or below to above zero), it outputs a gate signal (level set to 1) for a specific length of time.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b><i>Bug fixes include:</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- Fixed bug with All Notes Off button so non-polyphonic modules are unaffected.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- Fixed white-on-white text color issues when using a dark color theme in SuperCollider IDE.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b><i>Other changes include:</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All <b>Envelope</b> modules (mono & polyphonic) now have an 'Env End Trig' output which sends a trigger when the envelope ends.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> <b>Curve Editing</b> has been enhanced - when drawing lines, if the <b>Shift</b> button is down when the mouse button is pressed, a line is drawn from the last drawn point to the current mouse point. This allows a chain of points to be linked together. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Loop Player & Loop Player St</b> have been enhanced: <br>
There's new loop type: 'Single shot - play whole loop'.<br>
Envelope parameters have been added for Attack, Release and Envelope curve.<br>
New Feel & Groove curves can change the level, timing & pitch of the loop while it plays. There are 2 curves each for Feel & Groove which can be morphed.<br>
Groove curves can also rearrange the order of the beats in a loop, or reverse them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Mono Env Curve</b> has a  new Gate mode:  'Looped with forced release' which is a gated & looped envelope with variable close time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Pitch Shifter & Pitch Shifter St</b> have been rebuilt and renamed <b>Pitch Shift & Pitch Shift St.</b></span><br>
The new versions have a Pitch Shift (in semitones) replacing the old Pitch Ratio so musical intervals can be created more easily.<br>
<b>Pitch Shift St</b> also has Stereo Shift which shifts the left and right channels’ pitch in opposite directions. This can be used for stereo detuning.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Pluck Synth</b> has a  new Pick type:  'Pluck input - Use pluck input for pick sound' which uses  external audio from another module or bus to create the initial pick sound. This allows for a much greater range of pluck sounds to be created.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Sample & Loop Banks</b>:</span><br>
When a saved system is opened, an error window will appear if there are any sample or loop banks with missing samples or loops.<br>
There are new buttons 'Search folder for missing samples/loops' & 'Replace selected sample/loop' so any sample/loop in a bank (missing or not) can be replaced with another one.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>X-Fader</b> modules now have editable cross-fade curves, including some DJ-oriented preset curves, to control the mix as the cross-fader moves.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>-----------------------------------------------------</b></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>WaveFold (mono &amp; stereo)</b> - distorts the input signal, by boosting the gain (amplitude) and adding harmonics using 4 layers of folding, wrapping, or clipping.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>WaveshaperX (mono &amp; stereo) </b>- adds distortion to the input signal using mix of 2 function curves, which can be drawn by hand or generated automatically based on harmonics and noise.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Dynamics</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Amp Comp</b> <b>(mono &amp; stereo)</b> - Psychoacoustic amplitude compensation - frequency-dependent amplitude reduction, the level of the input signal is reduced for higher frequencies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Balance</b> <b>(mono &amp; stereo)</b> - sets the incoming audio to be at the same level as one of two options: 1) the Target level, 2) the level of the mono audio side-chain signal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Noise Gate (mono &amp; stereo) -</b> can be used as a gate or ducker with an optional side-chain input. Reduces the level of the input signal when the level of the input or side-chain goes below (gate) or above (ducker) a certain threshold.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>SoftKnee Comp (mono &amp; stereo) - </b>responds to the amplitude (volume level) of an audio signal coming into it. A compressor reduces the level of the louder parts of signal. It has the effect of evening out the volume. The type of compression can be changed from Peak Compression to RMS Compression, which responds to a signal over a settable averaging time.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This release uses the new GUI system in SuperCollider which uses Qt, a cross-platform toolkit. At the time of release, it has so far only been tested on Mac OSX 10.8.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are various bug fixes (including MIDI notes sometimes sticking); metering now includes options for frequency analysis; and one new module has been added:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Pattern Code</b> - allows you to use SuperCollider Pattern code to control any modules in the system.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Release 082 (January 2012)</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b><i>Highlights:</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Building a system is quicker, with fewer mouse clicks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Interface building is also much easier and more flexible.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Note Stacker makes building multi-layered instruments much easier.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">OSC Remote is useful for remote control by phone, tablet, &amp; other OSC devices.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sample Player + (similar to Wave Synth +) adds many more possibilities to sample-based instruments.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b><i>The following new modules have been built:</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Convolution</b> (mono &amp; stereo) - Convolution uses impulse response samples to simulate reverbs, filters/EQ, microphones, speakers, amplifiers and for special effects.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Env Follow </b>(mono &amp; stereo) - this audio insert module matches the level of an audio signal to another audio signal that is being fed into the side-chain input.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Matrix A 8x8 / Matrix C 8x8</b> - These audio &amp; control modules mix 8 input signals into 8 output channels using a 64-knob matrix.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Mix Audio 8-1 / Mix Audio 16-2 / Mix Control 8-1- </b>These modules mix 8 mono audio signals / 8 stereo audio signals / 8 control signals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Mono to Stereo</b> - Converts a mono audio signal into a stereo signal by panning between the left and right channels.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>M-S Encoder </b>- this takes a stereo audio signal and converts into mid and side signals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>M-S Decoder </b>- this takes mid and side signals and converts them into a stereo audio signal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Note Stacker - </b>this triggered module makes no sound itself but instead triggers notes in other modules, with the option of modifying the pitch or velocity of the notes for various effects.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Up to 18 different modules can be triggered, arranged in 6 layers each with 3 output modules. The modules on a layer can be played together, rotated each time the layers is played, or randomly chosen. Each layer has curves for modifying the overall velocity response, as well as individual note level and tuning for each note across the keyboard range.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>OSC Control 2D -</b> outputs two control signals from OpenSound Control ('OSC') messages received.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>OSC Remote - </b>This<b> </b>module is designed for linking up an external device that sends multiple OSC messages - such as a phone or an iPad running TouchOSC, or another computer running the TX Modular system or other OSC software. Each OSC String is linked to an Action within the TX.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Sample Player+ (mono &amp; stereo) - </b>this is an enhanced version of the Sample Player module which includes a filter, 2 LFOs, an extra assignable envelope and a modulation matrix.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Transient Shape (mono &amp; stereo)</b> - this has replaced the Transient module. Attack and sustain of incoming audio can be separately controlled with the divide frequency affecting how attack and release are separated. Useful with drums, plucked and percussive sounds which have strong transients.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>X-Fader 2-1 C</b> (control source) module - for modulatable cross-fading between 2 control signals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b><i>Module changes include:</i></b></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Gain</b> modules (mono/stereo) - new Phase Invert<b> </b>buttons for inverting the phase of audio signals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Group Morph </b>module -<b> </b>this now has various 2D and Linear types of morph.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>MIDI Sustain Pedal and Pitchbend- </b>All Triggered Audio Source Modules now respond to Sustain Pedal and Pitchbend MIDI messages when MIDI Listen is activated.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Step Sequencer</b> is the new name for <b>Note Sequencer </b>- it was renamed for clarity since it sequences control values, velocities &amp; notes using steps.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Perlin Noise </b>module - a new control Rate Multiply has been added which controls the overall speed of the noise.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b><i>Other changes include:</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Audio Setup Window </b>- when the TX Modular system starts, this window opens first to set the Audio Device (i.e. Sound Card), and its Sample Rate and Buffer Size.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Volume slider &amp; 0dB button</b> - to set the overall output level for the system.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>History buttons &lt; &gt;</b> - to navigate to a previously viewed screen</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Interface Design improvements - GUI Properties</b> is now a floating window above the new <b>Design Interface</b> window which displays all widgets as you move or resize them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Interface Screens: Background Images</b> - Each Interface screen can have its own background image with widgets displayed over it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>New Interface Widget: Knob -</b> knobs take up less space than sliders for editing numerical parameters.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Sample Banks &amp; Loop Banks</b> - there are now 99 Sample &amp; Loop Banks available for more flexibility when creating larger systems (previously there was only 1 Sample &amp; 1 Loop Bank).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>SuperCollider users</b> <b>-</b> should find that TX Modular classes can be used more easily with multiple Quarks installed since the TX Modular uses many fewer class variables than before.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>TX Autonomous Standalone Systems</b> - It is now possible to make a copy of the TX Modular Standalone and modify it so that it automatically loads a pre-saved system. An autonomous system can't be edited or saved, and only the Interface screens are shown, so it's like a play-only version of a prebuilt TX Modular instrument or system. This might be useful for creating installations or easily distributable live instruments. The pre-saved system file and any external files are enclosed within the self-contained app so it's easy to give a standalone to other people. A Help file explains this in detail.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>User Options</b> - shown on the Notes &amp; Options screen, for choosing overall window colour &amp; transparency, adding a background image to the main window, and whether to ask for confirmation before deleting Modules and Channels.</span></p>

The layout of the Signal Flow window can be easily changed (by clicking and dragging).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Interface improvements</b> - The Design Layout window has been improved so you can easily resize widgets by dragging their corners and you can select multiple widgets for moving or cloning. This makes it much faster to design an interface. It is now possible to change the size of the Inteface so more controls can be displayed on larger monitors.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Preset Files - </b>All modules can have their settings saved as Preset Files, which can be reloaded at a later time. This also makes it easier to copy module settings between different systems. Presets are saved or loaded using the Do... popup button which is on the top row of each module's control window.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b><i>Other changes include:</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Note Sequencer </b>- the interface has been improved by creating a new Piano Roll window to edit notes as well as any of the other parameters for each step - velocity, probablity, delay, etc.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Compander</b> - there is now an option to use a side chain to control the compander.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Filter</b> - several new filter types have been added (including various Moog and TB303 emulations).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>MIDI Control Out</b> - this module sends out MIDI controller messages and has been improved. (Note: This has now become an Action module - in previous releases it was a Control Insert module).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Table Synth</b> - two new parameters - harmonic gap and scaling - give more flexibility in defining wavetables .</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Waveform</b> - It is now possible to use a note list instead of having a variable frequency. Using a note list forces the frequency of the waveform to conform to the notes of a selected scale/ mode/ chord in a chosen key - this is the same as quantizing the frequency to a scale. The note list position can be modulated.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Release 074 (December 2007)</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Changes include:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For simplicity, all releases are now given a 3-digit number.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The <b>Stereo Loop Player</b> can now play both mono and stereo loops.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The <b>Stereo Sample Player</b> can now play both mono and stereo samples.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Various <b><i>new modules</i></b> have been built:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Action Sequencer</b> - this can trigger all kinds of actions at specific times. Actions are commands or instructions for any modules in the system, such as changing the settings of any module in the system, triggering notes to play, starting and stopping other sequencers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>CyclOSC Colour</b> - this module analyses video data coming in from a video camera to check for the presence of a particular target colour which you can set.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You can also to define a zone which means that the target is looked for in only certain parts of the video grid. This is useful for triggering events only when a target colour enters a space. For example, by adding multiple modules you can create colour-sensitive hot-zones in an interactive performance or installation space.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>CyclOSC Grey</b> - this module is similar to CyclOSC Colour except it looks for a shade of grey instead of a colour.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>EQ Graphic </b>(audio insert) module - adjust the EQ of an audio signal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>OSC Out</b> - this<b> </b>module sends an OSC message to up to 10 different network addresses. This allows communication across a network to other TX Modular systems running on other computers, or to any software (such as Processing &amp; Max/MSP) that can respond to OSC messages.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>OSC Trigger</b> - this can trigger up to 10 actions when OSC messages are received as long as the OSC message begins with a string that matches the OSC string on the screen. OSC message arguments can be passed to the actions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>OSC Controller - </b>outputs a control signal from OpenSound Control ('OSC') messages received. (This came out in a previous release, but I forgot to mention it.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>QC Particles</b> - this module creates a new window which contains a video screen running a 3D particle system animation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>-----------------------------------------------------</b></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Release 0.10.7 (April 2007)</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>StandAlone</b> versions of the TX Modular for OS X Tiger and Panther have been built.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A <b>Help </b>system has now been completed, with specific help buttons in every module.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The opening of saved systems is much faster now (±3 times as quick).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In many modules there are now <b>presets</b> for things like envelope shapes or frequency ranges.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Various <b><i>new modules</i></b> have been built:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Audio Trigger</b> (control source) - triggers other modules when the amplitude (volume level) of audio coming into it goes above a certain level.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Filter Synth </b>(audio source) module - creates triggered filters (from MIDI or sequencers) which use an audio side chain for input. Each filter is velocity-sensitive and has its own envelope - like the wave synth module</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Gain </b>(audio insert) module - adjust the gain (volume level) of an audio signal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Granulator</b> (audio source) module - granulates any mono sample in the sample bank creating a stereo output.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Limiter </b>(audio insert) module - keeps an audio signal below its threshold.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>MultiTap Delay</b> (audio insert) module - for rhythmic delay effects.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Normalizer</b> (audio insert) module - flattens the dynamics of an audio signal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Notch Phaser </b>(audio insert) module - uses notch filters to create phasing effect.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Phaser </b>(audio insert) module - uses allpass delays to create phasing effect.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Sample and Hold</b> (control insert) module for triggered sampling the levels of a control source - this can also function as a Gate and Hold unit for other effects .</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>StereoWidth </b>(audio insert) module - allows stereo width to be changed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Transient</b> (audio insert) module - transient shaper, limits the slope of an audio signal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Trigger Impulse</b> (control source) module - creates short trigger impulses, for example to trigger the new Sample and Hold module. This can be sequenced or triggered via MIDI.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>X-Fader</b> (audio source) module - mono and stereo versions allow modulatable cross-fading between 2 audio signals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b><i>Other changes</i></b> include:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The <b>Sequencer</b> has been renamed <b>Note Sequencer</b> and has had various enhancements. On the new global tab, there are buttons to mute the output, to use a random trigger (as opposed to a clock) based on the BPM, and an option to randomise the step order every cycle. Sequencer steps can now be put into up to 8 groups so that they can be controlled by widgets on the Front Interface screens - this makes the sequencer dynamically controllable - good for gestural control while playing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The <b>File Player</b> mono/stereo modules have been improved with better control capability from interface screens.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The <b>Waveform </b>module now has a stereo version with a beats frequency control for wide stereo effects or for creating binaural beats.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The <b>Table Synth</b> module now allows frequency modulation through a modulation input (using the modulation options button in the Table Synth window).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Modules <b>Ring Mod</b>, <b>Vocoder</b>, &amp; <b>VocoderFX </b>now have Dry-Wet Mix controls.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>-----------------------------------------------------</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Release 0.10.6 (August 2006)</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As well as fixing various bugs, this version has an more streamlined main window and a new <b>interface</b> system where users can design a front screen with objects that can control multiple modules. I haven't yet had time to update the other help files with details of how to use the new interface system. There are some examples which use the new interface, so have a look at those to get an idea of how you could use it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The <b>sequencer</b> module is now much more powerful: It can now have up to 64 steps (used to be 16), there is a new delay option for making individual steps late (as in swing patterns), you can now chain patterns together, and you can apply all kinds of processes to patterns including generating new ones from many types of scales.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A new <b>Table Synth</b> module has been built which allows you to create wavetables by mixing harmonics in various proportions. You can have up to 8 wavetables and smoothly mix between them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>-----------------------------------------------------</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Release 0.10.41 (January 2006)</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This version should display more easily on 12 inch powerbooks, the main screen layout has been adjusted slightly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Lag module has been renamed Smooth and now includes linear and exponential smoothing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I have decided to give out this release even though it has some known bugs (see help file "Known Bugs"). So it very much a <b>TEST</b> system and I will release new versions as and when bugs are solved.</span></p>
